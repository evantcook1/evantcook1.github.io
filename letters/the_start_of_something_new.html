        <p>
          Over the years I've had many starts and stops with
          programming/coding/software engineering. I've found myself, yet again,
          at another start. I'm not sure why, but this time feels a bit
          different.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe it's because this time I have a reason and purpose behind it. In
          the past, it often felt like something I <i>should</i> do. This time,
          it's something I want to do. I want to build things, and I want some
          of those things to be on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also want to write, which is why I'm also using this as an
          opportunity to share my journey. This Letter, the term I use to
          describe my articles or blog posts, is the first example.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually, this site in its entirety is the first example. Every aspect
          of this website I created from scratch. This isn't to say I didn't
          have some help. I'm enrolled in a Web Developer bootcamp and spent a
          bit of time with
          <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> before that. And,
          I'd be lying if I said I wasn't using ChatGPT to help me populate the
          html. However, a direct copy/paste from ChatGPT, at least for now
          while I'm in the early days of learning, is off limits. if I use
          ChatGPT, I rewrite the code by hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          One look at this site, at least in late April of 2024, and it should
          be obvious I created this myself. The styling is minimal &lpar;ok,
          basically non existent.&rpar;, as I'm still deep into the HTML portion
          of the bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, I want to make sure that I'm applying what I'm learning. Which I
          why I'm using this site both as a portfolio and as a training ground.
          As I learn something new, I'm going to find a way to embed that into
          this site, at least where it makes sense.
        </p>
        <p>Today's addition was this blog and Letter. The home page was from a couple weeks ago and is my index.html file. Now,
            I added a stand alone blog.html file for the blog landing page, a sub-folder to house all the Letters, and now I'm roudning things
            out with this inaugural letter.
